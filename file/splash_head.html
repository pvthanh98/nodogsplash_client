Content:
	Nodogsplash (NDS), by default, serves this splash page (splash.html)
	when a client device Captive Portal Detection (CPD) process
	attempts to send a port 80 request to the Internet.

	You may either embed css in this file or use a separate .css file
	in the same directory as this file, as demonstrated here.

	It should be noted when designing a custom splash page
	that for security reasons many CPD implementations:
		Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
		Prohibit the use of href links.
		Prohibit downloading of external files
			(including .css and .js).
		Prohibit the execution of javascript.

Authentication:
	A client is authenticated on submitting an HTTP form, method=get,
	passing $authaction, $tok and $redir.

	It is also possible to authenticate using an href link to
	$authtarget but be aware that many device Captive Portal Detection
	processes prohibit href links, so this method may not work with
	all client devices.

Available variables:
	error_msg: $error_msg
	gatewayname: $gatewayname
	tok: $tok
	redir: $redir
	authaction: $authaction
	denyaction: $denyaction
	authtarget: $authtarget
	clientip: $clientip
	clientmac: $clientmac
	clientupload: $clientupload
	clientdownload: $clientdownload
	gatewaymac: $gatewaymac
	nclients: $nclients
	maxclients: $maxclients
	uptime: $uptime

Additional Variables that can be passed back via the HTTP get,
or appended to the query string of the authtarget link:
	username
	password
